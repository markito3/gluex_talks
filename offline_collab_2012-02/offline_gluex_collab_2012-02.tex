\section{Software Topics}

\f{
\ft{Resource Management}
\bi
\I need scheme to deal with large, non-run dependent data files
\I e. g., magnetic field maps, material maps
\I Dmitry proposed conceptual design
\I uniform interface
\I local caching
\ei
}

\f{
\ft{HDDM C++ API}
\bi
\I HDDM = Hall D Data Model, API = application programmer's interface, C++ = C plus plus
\I memory management hidden from user
\I method to query for parent elements
\I STL container and iterators used
\I result: much more compact syntax, less thinking about location in the tree
\ei
}

\f{
\ft{Whither the CCDB?}
\bi
\I Beta release in the wild since November
  \bi
  \I functioning, full-featured shell interface
  \I JANA compatibility demonstrated
  \ei
\I Not much activity testing it
\I Not much activity documenting it
\I Deployment issues not fully implemented
\I Off-site accessible MySQL mirror: agreement in principle with IT Division
\I Not the default calibration repository yet
\ei
}

\f{
\ft{Miscellaneous Topics}
\bi
\I Beni reported increase in number of photons in the b1pi job last November.
\I Heard a report from Gagik Gavalian on CLARA-based DST analysis system using data in HCF5 format.
\I Memory explosion problem found and fixed.
  \bi
  \I was causing irritation of sysadmin personnel at grid sites
  \I problem with never-ending propagation of tracks at 90 degrees with hits in FDC
  \I fixed in sim-recon-2012-01-27
  \ei
\I Volatile disk
  \bi
  \I ``scratch'' disk available from Batch Farm at JLab
  \I up to 40 TB
  \I could be used as staging disk before writing to tape
  \I in addition to 9 TB of work disk space
  \ei

\section{Calorimetry Sub-Group Progress}

\f{
\ft{New BCAL Reconstruction Algorithm}
\bi
\I Matt Shepherd developed new reconstruction algorithm to replace legacy KLOE code.
\I Will Levine worked on integration and testing.
\I Added the 1-2-3-4 BCAL read-out granularity.
  \bi
  \I previously, no summing beyond optical
  \ei
\I Now the default
\ei
}

\f{
\ft{Cluster Fragmentation in the BCAL}
\bi
\I Will Levine studying this
\I Too many cluster reconstructed in BCAL (with both algorithms)
\I Many of these extra clusters come from poor z-resolution rather than split-off behavior
\I z-resolution (= time resolution) is simulated by mcsmear
\I poor z-resolution at low energy is due to contribution of dark hits
\ei
}

\f{
\ft{Will and Matt revisiting $b_1\pi$ events}
\bi
\I Assess allegations of extraneous/split clusters
\I Compare new and old BCAL reconstruction algorithms 
\ei

\section{Conclusions}

\f{
\ft{Conclusions}
\bi
\I Progress on many fronts
  \bi
  \I Software Review Preparations: David's talk yesterday
  \I Tracking: Simon's talk to follow
  \ei
\I Upcoming discussions:
  \bi
  \I Reconstructed data format
  \I EventStore: CLEO-inspired analysis model
    \bi
    \I skims of event pointers, rather than events
    \I data format independent
    \ei
  \I Stress test of offline reconstruction/analysis chain
