\f{
\ft{Resource Management}
\bi
\I need scheme to deal with large, non-run dependent data files
\I e. g., magnetic field maps, material maps
\I Dmitry proposed conceptual design
\I uniform interface

\f{
\ft{Whither the CCDB?}
\bi
\I Beta release in the wild since November
  \bi
  \I functioning, full-featured shell interface
  \I JANA compatibility demonstrated
  \ei
\I Not much activity testing it
