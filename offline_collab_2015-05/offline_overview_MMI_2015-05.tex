\f{\ft{E\&M background simulation}

\bi
\I Beam-related out-of-time E\&M background major fraction of CPU time for simulated data
\I Want to use a library of background events, overlay on simulated physics events 
\I David Lawrence has system for combining hits from two event HDDM event streams.
\I May be possible to take real data with random trigger as background library.
\I Sean Dobbs has volunteered to look at this.
