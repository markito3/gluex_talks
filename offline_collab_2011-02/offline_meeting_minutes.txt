GlueX Offline Meeting, September 21, 2010

      * Writing out error matrices to an HDDM file. David has implemented
        the writing of error matrices from track fits. Working on reading
        them in is in progress.
Calibration Database

     2. OSG client tools. Working with Bob Lukens of CNI, Richard can now
        successfully run the client tools at the lab. The last bit was to
        get the necessary ports open through firewall.

EVE: an event display environment

    Dmitry gave us an overview of [30]EVE, the Event Visualization
    Environment of ROOT. He has some experience using it for the SELEX
    experiment at Fermilab.

Correlating Hits with Tracks

   Beni presented recent changes that are a precursor to being able to
   correlate reconstructed charged tracks with Monte-Carlo-generated
   particles by looking at the particle origin of the hits associated with
   the track.

Python encapsulation of C/C++ Code

    Craig gave an overview of his experience doing this with CLAS analysis
    software. See [38]his slides for details. He used the [39]SWIG package
    to auto-generate the glue code to make the compiled code available from
    a Python script.

    We thought of examples where this
    approach might be used to wrap existing API's:
      * HDDM
      * EVIO
      * the new calibration database routines

GlueX Offline Meeting, December 1, 2010

FLUKA simulation of neutron flux

Sascha reviewed recent work on simulating radiation damage, especially,
but not limited to, that from neutrons in Hall D. The original
motivation was to study damage rates to SiPM's that will be used to
read-out the BCAL.

* David has eliminated a bunch of warnings that were coming from the
tracking code.

* David has been working on the simulation apparatus for the Compton
calorimeter being proposed for the η Primakoff experiment.

GEANT4

David raised the question of converting the Monte Carlo from GEANT3 to
GEANT4.

GlueX Offline Meeting, December 15, 2010

* Simon announced that he has added time and energy smearing to the
start counter in mcsmear.

Tagger hall geometry/simulation

Sascha led us through some recent work he has done, documented in a
[37]recent GlueX Note. 
The geometry configurations that were used have not been released for
public consumption yet. See Sascha if you have a need for them.

Random number seed policy

We formed a consensus around using /dev/urandom, at least initially. We
commissioned Richard to write an appropriate python script that would
produce a seed on standard output as an initial stab at a more robust
random seed strategy.

Parallelism Workshop

David gave some impressions from last week's [38]Workshop on
Parallelism in Experimental Nuclear Physics. Fifty five people
registered and a like number attended. There were lots of interesting
and informative talks, featured among them talks from folks outside the
JLab community. See [39]David's email for his summary for the
participants and a link to the virtual machine that has the hands-on
examples loaded on it.

Review of IT Readiness for the 12 GeV Era

* need an outline of remarks by all speakers by end of month
* the review will be around the 2nd week of March
* Graham will send around a spreadsheet, asking for updates to
computing requirements from various groups
* scheduled speakers: Bob Michaels from Hall A, Dennis Weygand from
Hall B, Mark Ito from Hall D, a representative from Hall C--TBA,
and Graham with an overview

Changes to TOF Code

Beni described recent changes he has made to the HDDM data model to
accommodate information from the Monte Carlo about "truth" information
related to time-of-flight hits. In some cases, new elements were
introduced to be able to keep both generated and detected information,
and some elements were expanded to store information about the particle
producing the hits.

A lot of discussion followed on the general idea of keeping generated
quantities ("truth") and detected quantities ("hits") separate in our
analysis. Some of Beni's changes seemed to violate this separation.
Beni, Mark, and David agreed to meet after the meeting to discuss
alternate approaches that preserve the information desired, but make
the above mentioned separation more explicit.

Tracking Issues

Kei presented a list of bugs/anomalies that he has come across in
running our reconstruction code. See [44]his talk for details. He
mentioned four items:

0. event processing hangs every ~1000 events for his event topology
1. pi+ events reconstructed as proton show “spike” in momentum at ~0.5
GeV/c
2. some events have direction of momentum “reversed”
3. values of variables are set to non-physical values when they cannot
be defined for a given track (leads to side-effects if not checked for
explicity)

GlueX Offline Meeting, January 26, 2011

Examination of the reconstruction algorithm as inherited from KLOE

    Mark mentioned that he had seen this phrase in the minutes of one of
    the calorimeter meetings (attributed to Zisis) and he wondered if this
    was an issue the offline group should be tracking or discussing or
    hearing about. Ryan commented that Dan Bennett and Matt Shepherd had
    made improvements to the code, but there are still some mysteries in
    the code that someone in the collaboration should figure out. Elton
    mentioned that Regina was starting to look at maintaining the BCAL
    code. David will check with Regina folks on the status of the effort.
