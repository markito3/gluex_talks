\f{\ft{generated particle and decay chain reporting}
  \bi
  \I Issue: in reconstructed Monte Carlo data want to know the entire particle production, decay, interaction chain
  \I PIC (Pesterer-in-Chief): Kei Moriya
  \I difficulties:
    \be
    \I some action in generator, some in Geant
    \I more than one generator, want uniform scheme
    \I electromagnetic showers produce huge numbers of secondaries, but some of these may be of interest to end user
    \ee
  \I partial solutions implemented
  \I need comprehensive solution, i. e., a design
  \I not high-level rocket science

\I We all know what we want: primary particles decaying to secondary particles decaying to tertiaries decaying to...or substitute "interacting" for "decaying".

\I Pythia (bggen) reports out this information perfectly, including
$\rho^0 \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\omega \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$

\I We want to use that, avoids problem of putting strong resonances decays into Geant.

\I Geant can be made to report out a similar information starting with particles it is told to track.

\I Problem: parentage (Jerry Springer problem)

\I We kick off Geant with particles $n$ steps down in the Pythia decay chain. Then Geant renumbers them (re-ids them) ignoring the id numbers assigned by Pythia and all Pythia generated geneological information (at least by default).

\I Result: geneological confusion

\I Also: hit-particle correlation, when associating hits with reponsible particles, only Geant ids are available

\I And also: EM shower suppression explicitly breaks geneology

\f{
Proposal: bridge the gap
\bi
\I make Geant 3 aware of generator-based geneology
\I probably requires modification of native Geant 3 routines
\I not unprecedented
\I will have to be re-implemented for Geant4
\I independent of current G4 development
\I UBUF anyone?
