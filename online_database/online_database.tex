\f{\ft{Introduction}
\bi
\I Many database efforts, largely independent
\I Large overlap
\I Expressions of dissatisfaction have been heard
\I Future development effort could be wasted
\I For now: a proposal
  \bi
  \I Work with current tools should not stop
  \I A picture of what a unified approach looks like
  \I A conceptual design
  \I Future direction to be discussed

\f{\ft{Conclusions}
\bi
\I We would benefit from a common approach.
  \bi
  \I Eliminate duplication of effort.
  \I Building on work of others could result in more advanced tools.
  \I Faster error diagnosis, smoother operations
  \ei
\I Hall D will have to use these tools for 10 years (hopefully).
\I We are hard up against commissioning, a dangerous time to try to re-tool (i.~e., schedule risk).
\I Questions:
  \bi
  \I Is unification a goal?
  \I If so, on what time scale?
  \I How much work is it really?
  \I Where does the manpower come from?
