\I Data Management Plan
  \bi
  \I From the JLab plan summary:
    \bi
    \I Jefferson Lab requires that valuable data...be managed in a way that allows future...researchers to be able to work with the data...this mandate includes the preservation of the data, documentation of the data format...run conditions and calibration databases, and...software used to read and process the data.
    \ei
  \I for the Lab and as a reference for researchers
  \I document hierarchy developed Lab-wide
  \I meeting with Library School folks from CMU
    \bi
    \I same problem as us: funding agencies want to to see this
    \ei
  \ei
\I Data Flow Tools
  \bi
  \I in a nutshell: specify and submit a series of jobs
  \I provide requisite bookkeeping service
  \I SciComp convened the committee; requirements document written
  \I implementation slowed by Lab re-organization
  \I will not be ready for this data challenge

\f{\ft{Conclusions}
\bi
\I Infrastructure is in place for commissioning
  \bi
  \I development driven from online data challenge fills in final pieces, especially ability to reconstruct EVIO-based data
  \I infrastructure needs filling:
    \bi
    \I monitoring histograms
    \I reconstructed quantity monitoring
    \ei
  \ei
\I On the road to smooth, efficient physics analysis
  \bi
  \I AmpTools, Analysis Library, BDT's and other MVA tools
  \ei
\I System improvements still require attention
   \bi
   \I EventStore
   \I Geant4
   \I Meta-data catalog
   \I code profiling
   \I photon reconstruction monitoring
   \I reconstruction algorithms may need review, \`a la BCAL
   \I automated shift scheduler ;-)
