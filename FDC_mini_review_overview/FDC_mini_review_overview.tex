The search for exotic mesons is at a turning point. The experiments at
BNL, Protvino, and at LEAR which have reported evidence for exotic
mesons have terminated data taking; data analysis is completed...new
experiments are ahead of us, COMPASS at CERN and BESIII in the
immediate future, the Hall-D experiment at the upgraded JLab
facility and PANDA at GSI in the medium-range future. --- Eberhard

  Recommendations (Hall D)

  \begin{enumerate}

    \I Priority should be given to studying design modifications that
    would significantly reduce the amount of material in the GlueX
    tracking chambers.

    \I Additional resources and expertise should be applied to the
    development of track reconstruction software for GlueX, and to a
    complete and realistic hit-level simulation of the GlueX
    spectrometer.
