The search for exotic mesons is at a turning
point...experiments...which have reported evidence for exotic mesons
have terminated data taking...new experiments are ahead of
us...[including] the Hall-D experiment at the upgraded JLab
facility...in the medium-range future. --- Eberhard Klempt

  \bi
  \I Map the spectrum of hybrid mesons (gluonic excitations)
    \bi
    \I Start with those with exotic quantum numbers
    \I Make contact with spectroscopy of non-exotic states
    \ei

  \I Analysis will require
    \bi
    \I partial-wave analysis
    \I identification of exclusive final states
    \I detailed understanding of backgrounds
    \I large event samples
    \I confirmation of states in multiple decay channels

  Recommendations (Hall D)

  \begin{enumerate}

    \I Priority should be given to studying design modifications that
    would significantly reduce the amount of material in the GlueX
    tracking chambers.

    \I Additional resources and expertise should be applied to the
    development of track reconstruction software for GlueX, and to a
    complete and realistic hit-level simulation of the GlueX
    spectrometer.
