The search for exotic mesons is at a turning point. The experiments at
BNL, Protvino, and at LEAR which have reported evidence for exotic
mesons have terminated data taking; data analysis is completed...new
experiments are ahead of us, COMPASS at CERN and BESIII in the
immediate future, the Hall-D experiment at the upgraded JLab
facility and PANDA at GSI in the medium-range future. --- Eberhard
Klempt

  \bi
  \I Map the spectrum of hybrid mesons (gluonic excitations)
    \bi
    \I Start with those with exotic quantum numbers
    \I Make contact with spectroscopy of non-exotic states
    \ei

  \I Analysis will require
    \bi
    \I partial-wave analysis
    \I identification of exclusive final states
    \I detailed understanding of backgrounds
    \I large event samples
    \I confirmation of states in multiple decay channels
