%# '''New release''' Mark put together a new release, [https://halldsvn.jlab.org/repos/tags/sim-recon-2010-05-17/RELEASE sim-recon-2010-05-17], announced yesterday.
%# '''Contact with Dmitri''' David and Mark have been in email contact with Dmitri Romanov about prospective work on a calibration database.
\I {\bf Writing out tracking results}. Implemented. HOWTO save tracking results to an HDDM or EVIO file for later playback written. (David)\ref{[[HOWTO save tracking results to an HDDM or EVIO file for later playback]]}.
\I {\bf Offline Computing change request} has been entered in the official project software. (Mark, Eugene)
\I {\bf GlueX Software Workshop}. Theme: parallel computing. Subcommittee formed David, Beni, Simon, and Sascha, Ed Brash, and Ole Hansen. To be held in December or January. Proposal to the JSA Initiative committee submitted. (David)
\I {\bf GlueX Computing Plan}. Effort started to revise estimates of resource requirements. Early stages. (Mark)
\I {\bf Custom matrix classes} to speed up tracking.\ref{Simon's talk} (Simon)

# June 1, 2010

\I {\bf Warning-Free code}. New policy.
%#* David mentioned that the next step would be to create histograms. Right now a root tree is produced but the only information available is that the reconstruction ran to completion. He has a script that will produce histograms and mail out the results. He and Mark will create an example that runs on the cron job output.
\I {\bf HOWTO do a kinematic fit for etapi0p events} written (Blake)\ref{[[HOWTO do a kinematic fit for etapi0p events]]}

\I {\bf HOWTO use a pre-built release} writen (Mark)\cite{pre-built}\bibitem{pre-built}{[[HOWTO use a pre-built release]]
