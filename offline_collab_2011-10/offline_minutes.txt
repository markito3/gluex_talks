==Definition of Primary Particles==

* Beni put in a system to correlate raw hits with generated particles.

** Used for studies

==IT Review==

* Review was held May 20, 2011
* Goal: get a good understanding of progress towards IT in the 12
GeV era, and discover if there are areas that might need increased
effort in the coming year
* Reviewed: DAQ, Halls A,B,C,D, Accelerator (Controls and Physics), Scientific Computing and LQCD, Management Information Systems (MIS), Computer Networking \& Infrastructure (CNI)
* Hall D (MMI) presented:
** Requirements: data rate, reconstruction time, MC needs, storage
** Status of the Software: geometry, simulation, reconstruction, calibration database
** Planning, Tests, System Engineering: project managements, code testing, source code control, documentation, communications, off-site computing use
* Committee report (privately obtained):
** General
*** clear...that there is an enourmous amount of work in progress...no critial showstoppers at this stage.
*** Consider: designate a person to be in charge of the big picture
*** Consider: identify pieces of DAQ and analysis chain...identify those in charge...demonstrate a plan for integration ans stress testing of the entire...chain.
*** Recommend: establish a more formal joint effort to ensure analysis software is ready... [among the Halls?]
*** Recommend: establish dates for stress tests
** Hall D
*** Finding: 2 FTE of software effort on staff...might...represent insufficient manpower
** Finding: computing requirements should be firmed up...include details on...offsite computing
** Finding: cost of tape...a very low figure...provides backup...
** Recommendation: progress...should be carefully watched...more staffing at JLab should be added to software development...firm commitments with MOU's from ...the user community should be obtained in the coming year.
** Recommendataion: Details for a significant off-site simulation should be fleshed out...letters of intent obtained...formal MOU's...obtained later...
** Recommendatation: keep a duplicate of all raw data
* Other Items
** some really good recommendations produced
** summer of next year for full review
** focus likely more on the Halls
** why is IT Division reviewing Physics and Accelerator Division?

==DFCALPhoton vs. DFCALShower==

* Mihajlo: new names for some of the calorimeter classes.
** The FCAL clases have been changed to be consistent with the naming convention used for the BCAL
** "clusters" and "showers"

==b1pi Fix==

reconstruction efficiency for the weekly automatic b1pi analysis started to show only 5% reconstruction efficiency when it used to be around 50%
The problem was found and fixed

==Grid Make System==

Richard describe a system he is developing to
# automatically install and build the GlueX software suite on an arbitrary Unix-based system and
# use the build to create user-specified output, the result of either simulation, reconstruction, and/or analysis.

    * June 15, 2011

* '''Offline Coordinator''': MMI for 2 more years

==Doxygen Documentation==

==New data format plug-ins==

** Elliott created two new plug-ins 
** '''danaevio plug-in'''. This plug-in takes raw hit objects and reconstructed objects and generates an EVIO tree
** '''rawevent plug-in'''.  Plug-in to take raw EVIO data and turn it into DANA objects

==Non-reproducible event reconstruction==

* Reported by Will
** changing four-vectors, particle roster
* Found and fixed by David
* Another 1\% PID problem found and fixed by Paul

==Restructuring particle classes==

** more intuitive
** reconstructs neutrons

==Cyber Event==

* Entrance point: webservers
* Exploit technical, not social engineering
* Many machines compromised, mainly Windows
* data "exfiltrated"
* weeks between initial intrusion and data shipment
* IT Division was extremely cautious about re-opening services
* New personal web partition introduced
* Attack apparently related to other intrusions elsewhere

==Translation Tables==

Elliott presented plan on storing the correspondences between electronic channel addresses and named detector elements.

** work in progress

==Tracking dE/dx update==

* Simon discovered a units problem
* fixed now

==BCAL reconstruction update==

Will led us through [[BCAL reconstruction 8/24/11|his wiki page]] describing recent work understanding photons detected in the BCAL. His summary is reproduced here:

* BCAL reconstruction seemed to be an obstacle in b1pi events
* Two reconstruction algorithms in tree: KLOE algorithm=default, "new" algorithm by matt s.
* Found two issues which lead to poor energy resolution at low E (fixes not checked in yet)
* "New" algorithm seems to be doing well for single-photon events
* Further study of b1pi, etc.
* Further fine-tuning needed, but maybe should wait until BCAL segmentation finalized?

Note that this is work in progress.

==BCAL Reconstruction Update==

Will reported that the BCAL seems to do well for single photon events. He is also starting to look at implementing the new 1-2-3-4 segmentation for the read-out.

Matt mentioned that the read-out change should be easy, modulo calibration. There is a header file that defines the geometry.
