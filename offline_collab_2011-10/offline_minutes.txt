==Environment management and directory structure==

Maurizio described a scheme for setting up environment variables for the major software packages in common use at JLab, such as Geant4 and JANA. Defaults are provided for all values but user-defined values can be set to over-ride the defaults. He has also produced rpm's and deb's to allow installation of pre-compiled files on non-JLab-CUE machines. See [https://halldweb1.jlab.org/talks/2011-3Q/jlab_environment.pdf his talk] for details.

==Object-relational mapping (ORM) and an online database==

Dmitry gave an introduction to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping ORM's] focusing on the [http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/ ODB] (not [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol%27_Dirty_Bastard ODB], may he [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_in_peace RIP]) implementation for bridging the gap between a MySQL database and C++ code. He presented the ideas in the context of a simple database application that he and Sascha have been developing to describe read-out crates and their contents. See [https://halldweb1.jlab.org/talks/2011-3Q/ORM_for_Cpp.pptx his slides] for details.

==Review of minutes from the last meeting==

==Proposal to shrink the DST data format size==

Richard objected to the title of this agenda item. Nonetheless...

He walked us through the [http://argus.phys.uregina.ca/cgi-bin/private/DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=1799 recently circulated spreadsheet] detailing the contents of the proposed DST and the anticipated savings in space for each reconstructed C++ class. The idea is to save enough information to reconstitute the targeted DANA classes minimizing the information while keeping the classes useful for data analysis.

Some random notes:
* The particle list cuts only di-quarks from those generated by PYTHIA
* A compression scheme is possible and there were several proposals on how to do it.
* The exact format of the serialized data is yet to be determined.

==Tracking dE/dx update==

Simon led us through [[Tracking dE/dx update|his wiki page]]. Executive summary:
* units problem
* fixed now

==BCAL reconstruction update==

Will led us through [[BCAL reconstruction 8/24/11|his wiki page]] describing recent work understanding photons detected in the BCAL. His summary is reproduced here:

* BCAL reconstruction seemed to be an obstacle in b1pi events
* Two reconstruction algorithms in tree: KLOE algorithm=default, "new" algorithm by matt s.
* Found two issues which lead to poor energy resolution at low E (fixes not checked in yet)
* "New" algorithm seems to be doing well for single-photon events
* Further study of b1pi, etc.
* Further fine-tuning needed, but maybe should wait until BCAL segmentation finalized?

Note that this is work in progress.

==[https://mailman.jlab.org/pipermail/halld-offline/2011-July/000696.html FDC Changes in GSIM] and  [https://mailman.jlab.org/pipermail/halld-offline/2011-August/000717.html restoration of default behavior]==

The title of this section says it all. The links in the title reference recent emails describing Simon's recent activity in the named areas. His summary (quoted from the agenda):

* Default behavior (same as old): only the time at the doca is reported (no explicit cluster generation).
* Drift times and diffusion computed based on results of Garfield simulations for nominal gas mixtures for FDC and CDC.

    * September 7, 2011

==BCAL Reconstruction Update==

Will reported that the BCAL seems to do well for single photon events. He is also starting to look at implementing the new 1-2-3-4 segmentation for the read-out.

Matt mentioned that the read-out change should be easy, modulo calibration. There is a header file that defines the geometry.

==Reconstruction chi-squared/uncertainty update==

Curtis posted a [http://argus.phys.uregina.ca/cgi-bin/private/DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=1802 document on the DocDB] from PANDA, describing the scheme for their central tracking

Simon reported a pattern with some tracks with chi-squared problems. In the forward direction problems are correlated with track finding producing candidates with the wrong charge hypothesis.

Paul presented a [[Mattione Update 09072011|wiki page]] summarizing work to study reported errors from the FCAL, BCAL, and TOF. He decided to focus on these detectors since others are working on tracking errors. Some of his observations:
* There an energy-dependent offset between simulated and reconstructed times in the FCAL of about 2 ns.
* The observed FCAL energy resolution is about 50-60% greater than the value from the function that reports errors in the reconstruction.
* The TOF also shows a small offset, about 150 ps, in reconstructed time.
See his page for details.

We agreed on a convention for reported times from reconstruction, the time when the particle crosses the inner surface of the detector. Some of the time offsets may be due to the correction used for doing this.

==Brainstorming Reconstruction Issues==

Other discussion items not described above.

* Beni: many more reconstructed photons than the number generated. Details on his [[B1pi tests Sep. 2011|b1pi analysis wiki page]].
* Beni: reconstruction efficiency seems very low for protons. Again see his wiki page.
** Will thinks that the problem was not as bad a few months ago.
* Simon/Mark: In general, track down major causes of complete failure of track fitting and finding in both single-particle and multi-particle events.
* Paul will present a design for how TOF information should be used. [?]
* Beni will present HERMES particle ID scheme.
* Mark will add new items to list on the [[Reconstruction Tasks and Topics for Further Development]] page.

Matt proposed that we have standing agenda items at the Physics and Offline meetings with conveners reporting on progress in three major areas:

* Tracking: Simon
* PID: Paul
* Photons: Matt

They will get together and organize the list from the wiki page and assign priorities.

==Reconstruction sub-group reports==

===Calorimetry===

Matt gave the report.

* switch from 3-3-4 segmentation to 1-2-3-4 segmentation
** geometry specification not as flexible as originally thought
** Will is working on it
* timing offsets
** talking to Mihajlo: time is set by time of highest energy block
** x,y,z is not taken into account
** will take some work and attention: Matt will work on this

===Tracking===

Simon gave the report.

* some problems have to do with the quality of track candidates
** found issues with starting angle guess for very forward going tracks
** fixed up angle in track candidate
* some other minor changes
* farming out fiducial cut study a possible issue
** note: design goal for forward direction: down to one degree

===PID===

Paul gave the report.

* revised PID scheme: see [[Media:Mattione_PID_Presentation.pdf|his slides]]
** original slides presented at last Physics meeting
** changes based on feedback received on email list
** referred us to the slides for details
* Beni: HERMES scheme used log of prob ratios
** Beni will send around description of the scheme
* idea: instead of adding chi-squared's, try to weight chi-squared from different sources
** the way to do that is not clear
** errors may be correlated
** motivation: what if a single hit on a track if spurious: isn't that an out-sized effect on the sum of chi-squared's?
** some skepticism expressed about validity of this concern
* update on uncertainties
** see [[Mattione_Update_09212011|his wiki page]] for details
** showed plots of measured uncertainties in position and energy for the TOF as a function of both position and energy

==BCAL Reconstruction Update==

Will described his recent work. See [[BCAL_reconstruction_9/21/11|his wiki page]] for details.

* working on the new 1-2-3-4 segmentation of the BCAL
* did some studies with &pi;<sup>0</sup>'s and resulting errors from kinematic fitting (problem wiht phi error)
* David remarked that there is a mechanism to vary thresholds in the code now, but that is probably not how it will be done in the end.
* Consensus was that we should retain the KLOE reconstruction scheme as the default for now.

==Plug-in to extract single particles from multi-particle events==

David described a new plug-in that recasts one multi-particle into one (or more) single particle event(s). The user selects the particle type of interest and only that particle appears in the output event. This allows single particle studies with spectra that match that found with a multi-particle event generator. See [[Media:20110921extract_ptype_hddm.pdf|his slide]] for details.

==Tracking explained==

Simon gave us a summary of the method used for charged track finding and fitting. See [https://halldweb1.jlab.org/talks/2011-3Q/trackingSep21_2011.pdf his slides] for details. In addition to describing the process, he also showed studies of the quality of the results, and outlined issues yet to be resolved.
