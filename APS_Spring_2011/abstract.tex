Reconstruction Software for the GlueX Experiment at Jefferson Lab

The GlueX Experiment in Hall D at Jeffferson Lab is scheduled to start
commissioning in the Summer of 2015. The new detector will record
events created with a new beamline that will deliver tagged, coherent
bremsstrahlung photons with an endpoint of 11 GeV and a prominent
coherent peak at 9 GeV. Reconstruction software will have to output
both charged and neutral particles. To facilitate a partial wave
analysis of final states, high single particle efficiency will be
required. The general approach to offline reconstruction software will
be presented, including resource requirements and technology choices.
