\f{\ft{Not Everything Needs to be in Git}
  \bi
  \I spectrum of projects, only some would migrate to Git
    \bi
    \I resumes
    \I GlueX notes
    \I talks
    \I analysis plugins
    \I computing support scripts
    \I reconstruction code
    \I papers
    \ei
  \I concentrate on sim-recon/hdds for now

\f{\ft{Subversion vs.\ Git: Repository Multiplicity}

  \bi
  \I Subversion: one and only one
  \I Git: many
  \I svn: network access necessary for repo-dependent operations, git: repo is local
  \I git: need to impose administrative controls, i.\ e., structure, workflow, rules
  \I git: you clone a repo to get a local copy of entire repo
  \I git repo ``remembers'' its parent, every commit has fingerprint, commits arranged in branches, tree of fingerprints enables comparison of different repos
  \I Public vs.\ Private: svn only has a public repo, git: public repos visible to all, private repos on local disks
  \ei
}

\f{\ft{Git vs.\ Subversion: Commits}
\bi
\I Scope of Commits
  \bi
  \I Subversion: commits all go to The Repository, affects everyone unless on a branch
  \I Git: commits are local, thus ``branching'' is automatic
  \I Advantage of development on a branch: save work as you go, but before it is ready for others
  \ei
\I Nature of Commits
  \bi
  \I Subversion: one step
  \I Git: two-steps
  \I git: first, files are staged for commit (git add), then committed (git commit)
  \I set of staged files independent of set of local files independent of committed versions files
  \I enables grouping of changes meant to implement fix or feature
  \ei

\f{\ft{Using Git}
  \bi
  \I Making a new repository: git\ clone\ $<$parent\_URL$>$
    \bi
    \I local directory tree
    \I .git directory at top-level only, repo information
    \ei
  \I Checking out a branch: git\ checkout\ $<$branch\_name$>$
    \bi
    \I local directory tree put into context of branch
    \ei
  \I Moving changes from branch to branch: git\ merge\ $<$source\_branch\_name$>$
  \I Moving changes back to the parent repo: git\ push\ $<$target\_URL$>$
  \I Bringing local repository up-to-date with parent repo: git\ fetch, git\ pull
  \ei
}

\f{\ft{Workflow Models}
  \be
  \I One Public Repo, Master Branch
    \bi
    \I clone the repo
    \I work on master branch
    \I push changes to master branch
    \I equivalent to traditional ``trunk'' system
    \ei
  \I One Public Repo, Topic Branch, Self Merge
    \bi
    \I clone the repo
    \I work on master branch or local topic branch
    \I push changes to topic branch
    \I merge into the master branch
    \ei
  \I One Public Repo, Topic Branch, Integrator Merge
    \bi
    \I Same as previous except do not merge yourself, issue pull request to Integrator: please bring in my changes
    \ei
  \I Multiple Public Repos, Integrator Merge
    \bi
    \I each developer has public repo
    \I developers push to their own public repo, topic branch
    \I issue pull request to Integrator
    \I Integrator pulls and merges
    \ei
  \ee
}

\f{\ft{Nice Git Features}
\bi
\I fast
\I complete command line help, just like svn
\I helpful error messages; alternates offered; missing actions suggested
\I GitHub added-value items
\ei
}

\f{\ft{Extra Steps When Using Git}
\bi
\I Need to invent and enforce workflow structure/policy
\I Another system to learn
\I Extra steps in workflow
\ei
}

\f{\ft{How to Manage Conversion?}
  \bi
  \I Conversion from Subversion to Git to GitHub a solved problem.
  \I Ideally: move instantaneously from svn as authority to git as authority
    \bi
    \I otherwise changes in one or other get lost
    \ei
  \I ...but climbing learning curve not instantaneous...
    \bi
    \I sudden switch could halt progress
    \ei
  \I Non-ideal: bi-directional maintenance of two systems? (yuck)
  \I More research to do...ideas welcome
  \ei
}

\f{\ft{Why Change?}
  \bi
  \I Better management of changes
  \I Better communication of changes
  \I Better documentation of changes
  \I Less down-time with broken code on trunk
  \ei
}
