\f{\ft{Proposal for GlueX Move from Subversion to Git}
There are two parts:
\be
\I Workflow
\I Switch-Over Procedure
\ee
}

\f{\ft{Workflow}
\bi
\I goal: topic branch off master branch in the public repository
\I how to get there:
  \bi
  \I create local repository
    \bi
    \I git clone https:/github.com/jeffersonlab/sim-recon
    \ei
  \I create a local topic branch
    \bi
    \I git branch my\_work
    \ei
  \I move to the new topic branch
    \bi
    \I git checkout my\_work
    \ei
  \I ... work on topic branch, make changes, add them, commit them...
  \I push local topic branch to public topic branch
    \bi
    \I git push origin my\_work:new\_bug\_fix
    \I creates branch "new\_bug\_fix" on public repository
    \ei
  \ei
\ei
}

\f{\ft{Workflow (continued)}
\bi
\I how to get there (continued):
  \bi
  \I issue pull request on GitHub
    \bi
    \I navigate to the branch, click on "pull request"
    \I creates action item on GitHub
    \I requests that changes on branch "new\_bug\_fix" be merged onto master branch on public repository
    \ei
  \I someone else acts on pull request on GitHub
    \bi
    \I navigate to open pull requests
    \I merge in changes
    \ei
  \ei
\ei
}

\f{\ft{Notes on this Workflow}
\bi
\I Everyone needs an account on GitHub.
\I Anyone can update the master branch.
\I Changes should go onto topic branches, but enforced only administratively.
\ei
}

\f{\ft{Switch-Over Procedure}
\be
\I Comment: Only HDDS and sim-recon will be converted.
\I Comment: Having two authoritative repositories is a contradiction in terms.
\I Schedule switch-over for COB, Wed., July 15.
\I Between now and then, people should check in changes to the Subversion repository.
\I Do final conversion from Subversion to Git overnight, Wed.\ to Thu.
  \bi
  \I Practice versions will be deleted.
  \ei
\I Open for business for Git after all-clear announcement Thursday morning.
\ee
}

\f{\ft{FAQs}

\be
\I What if I miss the deadline and have changes in Subversion that need to be checked in?
  \bi
  \I Check them into Subversion. The diffs from after the deadline will be obvious. Mark I.\ will work with you to make the corresponding changes in the Git repository.
  \ei
\I What if I get stuck in a Git situation that I don't understand?
  \bi
  \I Ask for help: Mark I., Justin, Hovanes, Richard Jones, Brad Sawatzky, Steve Wood, Mark Jones, Ed Brash, Balint Joo...
  \ei
\I What if we want to go back to Subversion?
  \bi
  \I There are tools to create Subversion repositories from Git repositories. We don't have experience with them. We should view this as a one-way street.
  \ei
\I What is likely to be the biggest problem with the conversion?
  \bi
  \I Lack of communication.
  \ei
\ee
