% data. Raw data on tape/disk at Jefferson Lab. DST’s produced at
% Jefferson Lab, on Tape/Disk. MiniDSTs produced at Jefferson Lab and
% then both analyzed on site and moved off site utilizing
% grid-ftp. 120s (1630s)

% 7 Simulation Lay out the model for GlueX simulation. Production both
% at Jefferson Lab and at remote sites. Simulation will produce
% MiniDSTs that will need to be moved. All other data is likely
% flushed. What are the expecte resources in outside sites? 120s
