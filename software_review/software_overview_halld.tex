% 2 Manpower Estimates A slide showing the broken out tasks with \%
% complete, manpower needed to complete and names of people with
% institutions that are responsible for the tasks. Conclusion that at
% least at the present, we appear to have sufficient manpower to
% complete the tasks in the time given. 120s (1210s)

% 3 Software Management A slide showing how the Offline group is
% organized, and how it interacts with the other groups involved in
% related tasks. 60s (1270s)

% 4 Data/Compute Model A slide based on Mark’s spread sheet showing
% the way that we estimate data volumes and CPU needs. Discuss phase
% I, II and III. 120s (1390s)

% 5 Calibration/Alignment What needs to be calibrated and how will it
% be done? What has been done already? pi0 calibration of the FCAL,
% CDC prototype alignment and calibration, others? Beam tests? 120s
% (1510s)

% 6 Data Analysis Model Lay out the model for analysis of GlueX
% data. Raw data on tape/disk at Jefferson Lab. DST’s produced at
% Jefferson Lab, on Tape/Disk. MiniDSTs produced at Jefferson Lab and
% then both analyzed on site and moved off site utilizing
% grid-ftp. 120s (1630s)

% 7 Simulation Lay out the model for GlueX simulation. Production both
% at Jefferson Lab and at remote sites. Simulation will produce
% MiniDSTs that will need to be moved. All other data is likely
% flushed. What are the expecte resources in outside sites? 120s
% (1760s)

% 8 Open Science Grid Discuss that GlueX is a virtual organization in
% the OSG. Some resources from outside are committed to the grid. 120s

% 9 Amplitude Analysis On GPUs 60s (1950s)

% 10 Data Challenge What sort of data challenge do we need? When? 60s
% (2000s)

% 11 Summary/Conclusion Summarize where we are and where we are
% going. List of what still needs to be done? Contingencies. 60s
