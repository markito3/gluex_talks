\f{\ft{Other Talks}
\bi
\I analysis workshop
\I BCAL improvements
\I Tracking improvements
\I Online data challenge
\I Software Review
\ei

\f{\ft{Top-level build scripts}
  \bi
  \I scripts for installing GlueX software on several flavors of Linux
  \I tested on CentOS 6, Scientific Linux 6, Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 18, LinuxMint 15, openSUSE 12.3
  \I installation steps
    \be
    \I prerequisites: gluex\_prereq\_<distribution>.sh
    \I subversion test: svn\_touch.sh
    \I install: gluex\_install.sh
    \ee
  \I builds: xerces-c, CERNLIB, ROOT, CLHEP, Geant4, GSL (Gnome Scientific Library), CCDB, JANA, HDDS, sim-recon, and set-up scripts
  \ei

\f{\ft{Work Flow}
  \bd
  \I[Work Flow Tools]: standard automation of large-scale, multiple job submission and tracking
  \I[Data Provenance]: having information on how data was processed and archiving tools necessary to re-analyze data in the future.
  \ed
  \bi
  \I SciComp willing to help
  \I Committee formed to set scope
  \I Meetings so far have been educating SciComp staff about issues
  \ei
}

\f{\ft{generated particle and decay chain reporting}
  \bi
  \I Issue: in reconstructed Monte Carlo data want to know the entire particle production, decay, interaction chain
  \I PIC (Pesterer-in-Chief): Kei Moriya
  \I difficulties:
    \be
    \I some action in generator, some in Geant
    \I more than one generator, want uniform scheme
    \I electromagnetic showers produce huge numbers of secondaries, but some of these may be of interest to end user
    \ee
  \I partial solutions implemented
  \I need comprehensive solution, i. e., a design
  \I not high-level rocket science
  \ei
}

\f{\ft{Data Challenge 2}
  \bi
  \I New software
    \bi
    \I fix bugs: improve job success efficiency 
    \I BCAL reconstruction
    \I CCDB
    \I latest tracking
    \I ROOT trees?
    \I improved REST?
    \ei
  \I Simulation Configuration Changes
    \bi
    \I add electromagnetic background
    \I add in dark noise in the BCAL
    \I open up photon window, especially to higher photon energy,
       perhaps 7.5 GeV to the end-point
    \ei
  \I System Improvements
    \bi
    \I farm management system at JLab
      \bi
      \I crude set of perl scripts now, full of kludges
      \I needs generalization, perhaps re-write
      \ei
    \I input and output data cataloging and management
      \bi
      \I database application?
      \I grid-based meta-data catalog?
