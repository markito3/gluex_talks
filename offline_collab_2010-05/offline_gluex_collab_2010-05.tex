\ft{Progress 1}
\bi
\I Dependency generation in the make scheme: revised the scheme for making dependency files in the BMS system (Mark)
\I Task priority ratings: priority ratings to the items on the Task List (Mark)
\I DANA-EVIO conversion, almost complete (Elliott)
\I PID scheme introduced (Simon)
\I Environment variable checking in the makefiles (Mark)
\I Auto-notification of build errors (Mark)
\I Noise Hits in mcsmear: default now is skip-noise-hit-generation mode (David)
\I GEANT4 for GlueX: sentiment for re-raising this issue
\ei
}
\f{
\ft{Progress 2}
\bi
\I Top-level structure of our simulation and reconstruction code: ``sim-recon'' is the new name, ``src'' a child directory (Mark)
\I ded, a new GlueX event display (Dave Heddle)
\I Improvements in full event reconstruction calorimeter clusters and the resulting photon objects (David)
\I $b_1\pi$/$\omega$ analysis (Elton)
\I Make system change: binaries depend on libraries (Mark)
\I Partial wave analysis, standard example: contact with experts has been made (Craig Bookwalter)
\I Interim scheme for versioning of calibration constants (Mark)
\I Material on Splitoffs (Curtis, Matt)
\ei

\f{
\ft{Progress 3}
\bi
\I Documentation Structure: ideas outlined (Mark)
\I BCAL reconstruction software responsibility: IU for now, Regina will re-acquire the job eventually (Matt, Zisis)
\I New Fine-Mesh B-field Option: interpolation was done in advance and the results stored as a map with a much smaller grid spacing (Simon)
\I Change request to the Project plan for ``Offline Computing'' needs to be redone; a draft has been submitted (Mark)
\I Successful build of reconstruction on MacOS 10.6 (David)
\I Tests of a SIMD version of DVector3: re-write of the DVector3 class to take advantage of the SSE hardware present on many x86 processors (Simon)
\I Script to run the ``b1pi" analysis is done: will be run as a weekly cron job (David)

\f{
\ft{Summary and Remarks}
\bi
\I Progress in many areas
\I Major current challenges
\be
\I Extraneous clusters from hadronic interactions
\I Speed of charged particle tracking
\bi
\I Technological fix?
\I Algorithmic fix?
\ei
\ee
\I Minor current challenges
\be
\I Output format? HDDM? EVIO? ROOT? All of the above?
\I Global timing and PID
\I Doing a native build on 64-bit OS's (e.\ g., Snow Leopard, Linux x86\_64)
\ee
\I Long-term challenges: see the Prioritized Task List
\I Need for better documentation
